• You have to manage the following conversions: diouxX with the following flags: hh, h, l and ll.
• You have to manage the following conversion: f with the following flags: l and L.
• You must manage the flags #0-+ and space
• You must manage the minimum field-width
• You must manage the precision

todo:	flags



check if fmt = "%" or one odd '%' ("%d%")

"warning: too many arguments for format"

0 add trailing 0s when min field width is given,
	is ignored when precision in numeric value(non float)
	x	has to be before mfw
	is ignored when - is given (Mac) (?)

- move padding behind result
	x	has to be before mfw
	only move the padding, the 0s from

1-9 add padding before result (min field width)
	x	has to be before prec
	this is the total amount of padding

.1-9 precision (padding for decimal point)
	%f: if mfw is presnt, padding = mfw - prec
	%rest: if mfw is present, prec is turned into 0 while the other padding in mfw remains ' '




x You have to manage the following conversions: csp
x You must manage %%
x diouxX
x f
x (?) make it so whatever comes after mfw is either prec or flag/conv
x space A blank should be left before a positive number produced by a signed conversion
	has to be before mfw
	%d %i %f

x + add a + for ONLY signed conversion
	has to be before mfw
	%d,%i,%f
X # add num base prefix to appropriate conversion (except for case of 0):
	has to be before mfw
	%x %X %o
