space A blank should be left before a positive number produced by a signed conversion
  has to be before mfw
  %d %i %f

# add num base prefix to appropriate conversion (except for case of 0):
  0x, 0X for %x and %X
  0 for %o
  0b for %b (conversion doesnt exist)
  has to be before mfw

0 add trailing 0s when min field width is given,
  is ignored when precision in numeric value(non float)
  is ignored when - is given (Mac)
  has to be before mfw

- add padding after result
  has to be before mfw

+ add a + for ONLY signed conversion
  has to be before mfw
  %d,%i,%f

1-9 add padding before result (min field width)
